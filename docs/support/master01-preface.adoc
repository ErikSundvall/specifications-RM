Users are encouraged to comment on and/or advise on these paragraphs as well as the main content.  Feedback should be provided either on the {openehr_technical_list}[technical mailing list], or on the {openehr_jira}/SPECPR/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:issues-panel[specifications issue tracker].

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR Reference Model specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs), such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal, automated derivations from the Reference Model, ITS conformance indicates RM conformance.
