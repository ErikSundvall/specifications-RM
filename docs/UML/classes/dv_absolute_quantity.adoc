|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*diff* (other: `DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY`): `DV_AMOUNT`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Difference of two quantities. +
The value of accuracy in the result is either: +
* the sum of the accuracies of the operands, if both present, or; +
* unknown, if either or both operand accuracies are unknown.

|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*add* (a_diff: `DV_AMOUNT`): `DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Addition of a differential amount to this quantity.  +
The value of accuracy in the result is either: +
* the sum of the accuracies of the operands, if both present, or; +
* unknown, if either or both operand accuracies are unknown.

|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*subtract* (a_diif: `DV_AMOUNT`): `DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Result of subtracting a differential amount from this quantity. +
The value of accuracy in the result is either: +
* the sum of the accuracies of the operands, if both present, or; +
* unknown, if either or both operand accuracies are unknown.
