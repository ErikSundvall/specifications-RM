|*Class*
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
2+^|*_DV_AMOUNT (abstract)_*

|*Description*
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
2+|Abstract class defining the concept of relative quantified  amounts'. For relative quantities, the  +' and  -' operators are defined (unlike descendants of DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY, such as the date/time types).

^|*Signature*
^|*Meaning*

|*0..1*
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*accuracy_is_percent*: `Boolean`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|If True, indicates that when this object was created, accuracy was recorded as a percent value; if False, as an absolute quantity value.

|*0..1 +
(redefined)*
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*accuracy*: `Real`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Accuracy of measurement, expressed either as a half-range percent value (accuracy_is_percent = True) or a half-range quantity. A value of 0 means that accuracy is 100%, i.e. no error. +
A value of unknown_accuracy_value means that accuracy was not recorded.

^|*Signature*
^|*Meaning*

|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*valid_percentage* (number: `Ordered_Numeric`): `Boolean`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Test whether a number is a valid percentage, i.e. between 0 and 100. 

|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*infix +* (other: `DV_AMOUNT`): `DV_AMOUNT`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Sum of this quantity and another whose formal type must be the difference type of this quantity. The value of accuracy in the result is either: +
* the sum of the accuracies of the operands, if both present, or; +
*both operand accuracies are unknown_accuracy_value. +
If the accuracy value is a percentage in one operand and not in the other, the form in the result is that of the larger operand.

|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*infix -* (other: `DV_AMOUNT`): `DV_AMOUNT`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Negated version of current object, such as used for representing a difference, e.g. a weight loss. +
The value of accuracy in the result is either: +
* the sum of the accuracies of the operands, if both present, or; +
* unknown, if either or both operand accuracies are unknown. +
If the accuracy value is a percentage in one operand and not in the other, the form in the result is that of the larger operand.

|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
|*prefix -*: `DV_AMOUNT`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|Negated version of current object, such as used for representing a difference, e.g. a weight loss.

|*infix =* (source: `DV_AMOUNT`): `DV_AMOUNT`
{set:cellbgcolor!}
|

|*Invariant*
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
2+|*_Accuracy_is_percent_validity_*: accuracy = 0 implies not accuracy_is_percent
{set:cellbgcolor!}

|
{set:cellbgcolor:lightblue}
2+|*_Accuracy_validity_*: accuracy_is_percent implies valid_percentage (accuracy)
